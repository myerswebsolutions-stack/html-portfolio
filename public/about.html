<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I’m a web developer with about five years of dedicated study and hands-on building under my belt. I specialize in crafting clean, responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and I’m always working to sharpen my skills and stay current with the ever-changing world of web development (seriously, JavaScript gets a new framework every time I blink).
I enjoy turning ideas into well-structured, user-friendly websites and love the mix of logic and creativity that web development demands. Whether I’m refining layouts, optimizing performance, or debugging that one line of code that really should’ve worked the first time, I’m committed to producing quality work.
When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning something new, experimenting with side projects, or pretending I totally meant to break the website before fixing it again.</p>
